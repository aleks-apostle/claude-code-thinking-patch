# Claude Code Thinking Display Patch

Make Claude Code's thinking blocks visible by default without pressing `ctrl+o`.

## The Problem

Claude Code collapses thinking blocks by default, showing only:
```
∴ Thought for 3s (ctrl+o to show thinking)
```

You have to press `ctrl+o` every time to see the actual thinking content. This patch makes thinking blocks visible inline automatically.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the .claude directory
cd ~/.claude

# Run the patch script
node patch-thinking.js

# Restart Claude Code
```

That's it! Thinking blocks now display inline without `ctrl+o`.

## What This Patch Does

**Before:**
```
∴ Thought for 3s (ctrl+o to show thinking)
[thinking content hidden]
```

**After:**
```
∴ Thinking…

  [thinking content displayed inline]
  The actual thinking process is now visible
  without any keyboard shortcuts needed
```

## How It Works

This patch modifies two locations in Claude Code's compiled JavaScript:

### Patch 1: Remove the Banner (Line 1909)
**Before:**
```javascript
function Mr2({streamMode:A}){
  // ... displays "Thought for Xs (ctrl+o to show thinking)"
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function Mr2({streamMode:A}){return null}
```

**Effect:** Removes the collapsed thinking banner entirely.

### Patch 2: Force Thinking Visibility (Line 2212)
**Before:**
```javascript
case"thinking":if(!K)return null;if(z)return null;
  return R8.createElement(S2B,{addMargin:B,param:A,isTranscriptMode:K});
```

**After:**
```javascript
case"thinking":if(z)return null;
  return R8.createElement(S2B,{addMargin:B,param:A,isTranscriptMode:!0});
```

**Effect:** Forces thinking content to render as if in transcript mode (visible).

## Files

- **Target:** `/Users/aleks/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js`
- **Patch Script:** `/Users/aleks/.claude/patch-thinking.js`
- **Backup:** `/Users/aleks/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js.backup`
- **Documentation:** `/Users/aleks/.claude/plan.md` (detailed analysis)

## Important: After Claude Code Updates

When you run `claude update`, the patches will be **overwritten**. You must re-apply them:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
node patch-thinking.js
# Restart Claude Code
```

The patch script automatically:
- Creates a backup before patching
- Applies both patches atomically
- Reports success or failure
- Safe to run multiple times

## Rollback

To restore the original behavior:

```bash
mv ~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js.backup \
   ~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js
```

Then restart Claude Code.

## Technical Details

### File Structure
- **cli.js:** 3,584 lines, 9.4 MB (heavily minified)
- **Version:** Claude Code 2.0.9+
- **Patches:** Non-invasive, minimal changes

### Why Two Patches?

1. **Mr2 Function:** Controls the UI banner shown after thinking completes
2. **Thinking Renderer:** Controls whether the actual thinking text is displayed

Both must be patched because they're separate systems:
- Patching only Mr2 → Blank line appears where thinking should be
- Patching only the renderer → Banner still shows "ctrl+o to show"

### Location Discovery Process

The patches target specific patterns in the minified code:
- **Line 1909:** Found by searching for `function Mr2({streamMode:A})`
- **Line 2212:** Found by searching for `case"thinking"` in the Y$6 function

These line numbers may change with Claude Code updates.

## Verification

Check if patches are applied:

```bash
# Check Mr2 patch
grep -n "function Mr2" ~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js

# Should show: function Mr2({streamMode:A}){return null}

# Check thinking visibility patch
grep -n 'case"thinking"' ~/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js

# Should show: case"thinking":if(z)return null;return R8.createElement(S2B,{addMargin:B,param:A,isTranscriptMode:!0});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Patch Script Says "Pattern not found"

This means:
1. Claude Code has been updated to a new version
2. The file structure has changed
3. The patches are already applied

**Solution:** Check if the patches are already working. If not, the code structure may have changed and the patterns need updating.

### Thinking Still Collapsed After Patching

**Solution:** You must restart Claude Code for changes to take effect.

### Backup File Missing

The patch script creates a backup automatically on first run. If missing, the script will warn you before making changes.

## Limitations

1. **Breaks on updates:** Must re-run after `claude update`
2. **Minified code:** Fragile, may break with version changes
3. **No official config:** This is a workaround until Anthropic adds a setting

## Feature Request

Consider requesting this as an official feature from Anthropic:
- Configuration option to always show thinking
- User preference in settings
- Toggle command like `/thinking show` or `/thinking hide`
